## The logo

## Credits

My favicon/logo (call it whatever you like) is based on
[hammer and keyboard in star - proletariat](https://openclipart.org/detail/168035/hammer-and-keyboard-in-star-proletariat)
published by [worker](https://openclipart.org/artist/worker) on [Openclipart](https://openclipart.org/).
The original image is released in the public domain, see ["All Clipart are Released into the Public Domain"](https://openclipart.org/share).
